# Audio Generation Prompts

## 1. Background Music (Loop)
"A continuous loop of chill Lofi hip hop instrumental. 70 BPM. Soft, jazzy piano chords, dusty drum breaks with side-chain compression, melancholic melody. Ambient texture of gentle rain against a window and distant city noise. Warm vinyl crackle and tape hiss saturation. Cozy, nostalgic, nighttime atmosphere for a pixel art room. No vocals."

## 2. The Kettle (One-shot)
"A short, soft synthesized steam whistle sound effect designed to blend into a lofi music track. Airy, melodic, warm tone, with heavy reverb and low-pass filtering. Not harsh or piercing. Sounds like a gentle flute sample on old tape."

## 3. The Cat (One-shot)
"A cute, gentle cat meow sound effect fitting a cozy lofi vibe. A short, single melodic sample, slightly pitched down and softened. Processed with warmth and a subtle bit-crush effect to sound retro. Like a soft synth pluck that resembles a meow."

## 4. The Computer (One-shot)
**Option A: Startup Chime**
"A short, retro computer startup chime for a pixel art computer, but softened for a lofi track. A gentle 8-bit synthesized arpeggio, warm tone, low fidelity, slightly muffled with tape saturation. Not sharp."

**Option B: Keyboard Click**
"A single, satisfying mechanical keyboard key press sound, heavily processed for lofi. Deep, thocky sound, filtered high frequencies, with soft tape noise texture. Sounds cozy and tactile."

## 5. The Window (Loop/Ambience)
"Continuous loop of soft rain tapping against a glass window pane, recorded from an indoor perspective. Muffled, cozy, and consistent texture. Low-fidelity sound with a low-pass filter to remove harsh high frequencies. No thunder, no heavy wind. Gentle, calming white noise suitable for a lofi background."
